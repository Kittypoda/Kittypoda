<h1>Hei, jeg er Oda!</h1>

<p>
I'm a front-end developer and designer who finds joy in making things beautiful â€” whether it's a website, a living space, or a garden patch.
</p>

<p>
With a background in graphic design and a growing set of development skills, I care about creating digital experiences that feel thoughtful, intuitive, and visually calm â€” and sometimes a little playful, too.
</p>

<p>
I'm currently finishing my studies in front-end development at Noroff. I still have a lot to learn, but I'm excited about the journey â€” especially the parts where design and development meet to make something fun, meaningful, or both.
</p>

<p>
If you're curious or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to chat.
</p>
